 <h1> What are the traditional event of Mohammad S.A.W. life?</h1>   
 <h2> According to Islamic tradition, his father died before Muhammad was born, and his mother died when he was a young child. He is usually said to have had 14 wives or concubines during his lifetime. Although polygamy was then prevalent in Arabic society, he was monogamously married to his first wife, Khadījah, until her death after about 25 years of marriage. He had four daughters and at least two sons (both of whom died as infants) with Khadījah and probably another son (who also died young) by a later wife or concubine, Māriyah. His youngest daughter, Fāṭimah, married Muhammad’s cousin ʿAlī, the fourth of Muhammad’s successors as leader of the Muslim community</h2>
